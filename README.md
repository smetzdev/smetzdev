# Yet another Web Developer...

Hey there!ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m Sascha, based in SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany.

I started building websites back in 2012 and consider myself a
professional since 2015. I've spent my first years building WordPress
sites, today i work mostly on the JAM Stack (I still like WordPress ðŸ˜…).
I also enjoy discovering the Cloud, in particular with AWS.

You can find me here (if you wanna):
