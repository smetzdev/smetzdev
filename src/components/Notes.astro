  <Paragraph>
    I like the idea of public learning and i do take a lot of notes, so i am
    sharing some of my notes via <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a>. These
    are not perfect, maybe not even up-to-date, but i find it important to share
    progress and not being affraid of making mistakes to some extend.
